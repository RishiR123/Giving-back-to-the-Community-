# How Linear Regression Works

The algorithm works by finding the best-fitting straight line (called the regression line) through the data points. It minimizes the difference between the predicted values and the actual values, using a method called **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**.

The linear relationship is expressed with the formula:

\[ y = mx + b \]

Where:
- \( y \) is the predicted output.
- \( m \) is the slope of the line (coefficient).
- \( x \) is the input feature.
- \( b \) is the y-intercept.
