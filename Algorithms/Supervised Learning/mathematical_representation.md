# Mathematical Representation of Linear Regression

The formula for a simple linear regression model is:

\[ y = mx + b \]

For multiple linear regression, the formula expands to:

\[ y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + ... + b_nx_n \]

Where:
- \( b_0 \) is the y-intercept.
- \( b_1, b_2, ..., b_n \) are the coefficients for each input feature \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \).
