# Example of Linear Regression

- **Dataset**: You can use a dataset like the **Boston Housing Dataset** or create your own for practice.
- **Goal**: Predict housing prices based on features like the number of rooms, location, etc.

Here is how you can structure your dataset:

| Feature 1 | Feature 2 | Target (Price) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
|    ...    |    ...    |       ...       |
|    ...    |    ...    |       ...       |
